### What I learned

This is my second HTML and CSS based code following the QR-COde challenge hosted at https://lively-fox-5b154d.netlify.app/

### Continued development

I wish to repeat this with REACT while I learn it. My idea would be to increase the ETH amount each time the page is refereshed.
